# choice-maker
A web app to make a random choice between inputs for when you can't decide.

Choicebot

JavaScript & jQuery

This was a fun app built out of necessity. My family is terrible at agreeing on where to go for dinner, so I decided to take the decision out of our hands. Choicebot was born. I like that it can take as many possible choices as you want to input. I pushed myself to more intricately blend my use of vanilla javaScript and jQuery for this project, and I love the result.
